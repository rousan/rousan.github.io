	<p>
		I try to build things from scratch to One for open source community and try solving hard problems with simpler
		methods regardless of its complexity. I have a passion for learning new technologies by applying my knowledge
		and skills in a challenging environment. I prefer to work in a competitive environment where every second you
		are required to prove how far you can go to be at the top.
		I believe in “Work is Worship”. Once I committed myself to a particular task, I make sure I finish it without
		compromising on the quality.
